            <p>This website allows you to search for the formation of rail services in Switzerland. Simply enter the train operator and number to see the expected vehicle formation.</p>
            <p>There are a few limitations:</p>
            <ul class="about-list">
              <li>You can only search for services departing <b>today</b> or up to <b>two days</b> in the future (although I have yet to find a formation loaded that far in advance)</li>
              <li>Not all services/operators are available - notably formations do not appear to be available for non-Swiss vehicles and for services that start/terminate in a different country</li>
              <li>Vehicle number searching only works for services that have been searched already (although I cache as many as possible during the maintenance window)</li>
              <li>The system only allows 5 queries per minute, so I cache the searches but you may still be rate limited</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br>Despite these limitations, I hope this site proves useful for helping you know what to expect on a given service. All data comes from <a href="https://opentransportdata.swiss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">opentransportdata.swiss</a> and I am not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data they provide. I'm also not an actual web developer so this site may break at any time!<br><br><br><br></p>
